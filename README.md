## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java JDK 8 or higher**: Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).
- **Maven or Gradle**: These tools help manage dependencies and build your project. Choose one based on your preference.

### Using Maven

If you are using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.bismark83</groupId>
    <artifactId>jazzy-framework</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Using Gradle

For Gradle users, add this line to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
implementation 'com.bismark83:jazzy-framework:1.0.0'
```

## Getting Started with Jazzy

Hereâ€™s a simple example to create a basic web application using Jazzy Framework.

### Step 1: Create a Simple Controller

Create a new Java class in the `controllers` directory.

```java
package controllers;

import jazzy.Framework;

public class HomeController {
    public void index() {
        Framework.response().send("Welcome to Jazzy Framework!");
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Define Routes

In your main application file, set up the routing.

```java
import jazzy.Framework;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Framework.get("/home", new HomeController()::index);
        Framework.start();
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Run Your Application

Compile and run your application. You should see "Welcome to Jazzy Framework!" when you navigate to `/home`.

## Routing

Jazzy Framework provides a straightforward way to define routes. You can set up routes for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

### Example Routes

```java
Framework.get("/users", new UserController()::list);
Framework.post("/users", new UserController()::create);
Framework.put("/users/:id", new UserController()::update);
Framework.delete("/users/:id", new UserController()::delete);
```

## Request and Response Handling

Jazzy Framework simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests and responses. You can access request parameters, headers, and body easily.

### Accessing Request Data

```java
public void create() {
    String name = Framework.request().getParameter("name");
    // Process the request
}
```

### Sending Responses

```java
public void sendResponse() {
    Framework.response().send("Data processed successfully!");
}
```

## Validation

Validation is crucial for ensuring data integrity. Jazzy Framework includes built-in validation features to help you manage user input effectively.

### Example Validation

```java
public void create() {
    String name = Framework.request().getParameter("name");
    if (name == null || name.isEmpty()) {
        Framework.response().send("Name is required.");
        return;
    }
    // Continue processing
}
```

## REST API Support

Creating RESTful APIs is straightforward with Jazzy Framework. You can define routes that correspond to standard HTTP methods.

### Example API

```java
Framework.get("/api/users", new UserController()::getAllUsers);
Framework.post("/api/users", new UserController()::createUser);
```

## Middleware

Jazzy Framework supports middleware, allowing you to execute code before or after your routes.

### Example Middleware

```java
Framework.use((req, res, next) -> {
    // Perform some action before the request
    next();
});
```

## Error Handling

Error handling is essential for providing a good user experience. Jazzy Framework allows you to define custom error handlers.

### Example Error Handler

```java
Framework.error((error) -> {
    Framework.response().send("An error occurred: " + error.getMessage());
});
```

## Logging

Logging is crucial for monitoring your application. Jazzy Framework provides a simple logging mechanism.

### Example Logging

```java
Framework.logger().info("User created successfully.");
```

## Testing

Testing your application is important to ensure its reliability. Jazzy Framework supports unit testing with popular testing frameworks.

### Example Test

```java
import org.junit.Test;

public class UserControllerTest {
    @Test
    public void testCreateUser() {
        // Write your test here
    }
}
```

## Deployment

Once your application is ready, you can deploy it to your preferred server. Jazzy Framework is compatible with various Java web servers, including Tomcat and Jetty.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Package your application** as a JAR file.
2. **Upload the JAR file** to your server.
3. **Start the server** and access your application.
